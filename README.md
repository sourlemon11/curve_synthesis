# What is this thing? #

This is a solution to a problem. The problem is that I need to generate a motion based on the
constrained geometry of my design. The design is to have four idler rollers
rotate around a driving roller all while the roller positions shrink along a
circle. Once I have the generated curve (or motion), I will be able to
synthesize a linkage design that approximates the four curves shown in
Matplolib. 

At first, I didn't expect to delve that much into Python. It was mostly used as
scripting in steps to arrive at my solution. I eventually built some
boilerplate code to hold variable and curve information. I didn't intend to do
this originally, but I wanted to out of a desire of refining my solution and interest in
the Python language.
